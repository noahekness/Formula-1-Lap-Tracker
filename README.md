# Formula-1-Lap-Tracker
Side project built using RStudio.

## Purpose
Meant to be a simple pipeline that users can choose their race, race type, and driver and the animation would show up automatically. 
  I went for the input/hands off approach to make it intuitive and pipelined in so the user has no barrier to entry. 

## Next steps  
In the future I would love to add more statistics or control over things. 
  This can also be a great springboard to making a dashboard instead!

## Additional comments
I would love feedback on this!
